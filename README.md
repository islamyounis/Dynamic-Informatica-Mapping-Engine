## Introduction
The XML-Streamline project introduces an innovative approach to automating ETL tasks  within the Informatica environment. This documentation guides on implementing the  SMX (Excel sheet), a crucial input for configuring each mapping.

## Project Overview
Project XML-Streamline aimed to address the challenge of handling extensive ETL tasks efficiently within Informatica. The objective was to create an XML engine that automates 
data processing, significantly reducing the time required for ETL processes and optimizing resource utilization. The engine utilizes an Excel sheet (SMX) as a source for 
configuring and customizing the ETL tasks.
